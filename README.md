# Set-Game
Written in Python 3.4.3 to play the card game Set! better than Sandra ever could.

Made with crazy amounts of functions for easier writability and readability, and heavily commented. In its current state it will create and play a game of Set! upon running.

How to use:
The class SetGame is written to not only be able to imitate a Set! deck, but to also play the game. 
Its methods include
  - SetGame.showDeck()
    - Will output the master deck as a list of 4-digit integers that represent cards
  - SetGame.showCard()
    - Will output the normal classification of a card given its 4-digit integer form
  - SetGame.shuffleDeck()
    - Will shuffle the master deck
  - SetGame.playSet()
    - Will make the computer play a game of Set! and output all playing field states and a list of all Set!'s collected when the game is completed.
